  ~> This project contains implementations of classical data structures in C
  using X-macro to generate generic code. The idea is that you have to
  "specialize" the structures by giving the type of their elements and the
  name you want to give to the structure. You could then use functions
  that are given.

  Structures that you could use by now :

    - *Linked Lists* (list)
    - Array-based dynamic *Queues* (queue)
    - Array-based dynamic *Stacks* (stack)

  What you could use at term :

    - Array-based dynamic *Vectors* (vector)
    - Skip *Lists* (skipList)
    - Binary-tree-based *Maps* (map)
    - *Hashtables* (hash-map)
    - AVL *Trees* (tree)
    - *Graphs* (graph)

~ Quick start guide :
`___________________'


  Each directory contains files to use a data structure. In each one you will
  find several files :

    - A .hxx file that contains macro to define the structure and its functions
    - A sample of code (main.c, struct.h, struct.c) that show you how to use it


  When you want to use a structure, create 2 files struct.h and struct.c. Put
  the struct.hxx in the same directory. Here is what you should obtain for
  each file :

  ~> struct.h

    #ifndef STRUCT_H_
    # define STRUCT_H_

    # include "struct.hxx"

    STRUCT_HEADER(My_type, Struct_name)

    #endif /* !STRUCT_H_ */

  __________

  ~> struct.c

    #include "struct.h"

    STRUCT_SOURCE(My_type, Struct_name)

  Now you can just compile it along with your project and/or package it
  as a Static / dynamic library.
